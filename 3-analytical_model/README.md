# Matlab `analytical model` project description

## About

This Matlab project describes analytically the performance of the dynamic fixed-point version of our accelerator. The analytical model we developed uses function/loop overhead and pipeline depth information from the Xilinx's HLS performance estimation. See the top-level `3-analytical_model/sqn_dfp/sqn_eval.m` file for more information.
